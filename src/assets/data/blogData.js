      <p>Everything you need to know about BS6 and its impact on the environment and why bike rentals are a safe bet to curb pollution to the environment.<br/>
       What is BS6?<br/>
In a nutshell, BS6 follows the regulations set by EURO VI, currently being followed in Europe. Starting 1st April, all new vehicles being manufactured and those hitting the road, will need to be BS6 compliant. And all of that starts with the engine, the very heart of a vehicle.<br/>
So what is the BS6 engine like?<br/>
For 2 wheelers, the carburetor, an intrinsic part of a vehicle, will now be replaced by an electronic fuel injection. As compared to BS4 (the emission norms being followed before BS6), Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) emissions will now reduce by 25% for petrol vehicles.

<br/>For diesel vehicles, Nitrogen Oxides will reduce by 68%. With regard to 2 wheelers, Nitrogen Oxides releases will need to be under 0.10gm/km.

<br/>For this to successfully happen, 2 wheelers plying on roads will have larger catalytic converters as well as electronic fuel injections. With these engineering upgrades, the cost for 2 wheelers will easily go up by 10-15%.
